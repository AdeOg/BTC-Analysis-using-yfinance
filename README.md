# BTC-Analysis-using-yfinance

Introduction
Bitcoin is one the most popular cryptocurrencies. It was the very first cryptocurrency that introduced blockchain technology. Having the spotlight, we decided to choose BTC as our subject of our financial analysis.
Data was first downloaded using yfinance and saved into a dataframe. The data for crypto prices was then plotted as a line chart using pandas plot function.

Graph description for cryptocurrency prices:
By the beginning of the year, the prices seemed to be declining with a general downward trend till the period between March and May, followed by a steady increase in prices which peaked by August, then started declining again till the end of the year.

As price had a declining pattern during most of time of the year, the lines of the European Option for the call and put were far apart and didn't meet. This finding was the same for the American Options.
